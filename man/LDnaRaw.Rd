\title{Produces necessary data for LDna from a matrix of pairwise LD values}
\usage{
LDnaRaw(LDmat, digits = 2, method = "single", mc.cores = NULL,
  fun = function(x) {     min(x, na.rm = TRUE) })
}
\arguments{
\item{LDmat}{Lower diagonal matrix of pairwise LD values, \eqn{R^2} is strongly recommended. Must include row and column names.}

\item{digits}{Number of digits for rounding r2 values.}

\item{method}{Specifies clustering medhod (see \code{\link{hclust}}), defaults to 'single'.}

\item{mc.cores}{Specifies number of cores for \code{\link{mclapply}}. \code{NULL} (default) uses \code{\link{lapply}}.}

\item{fun}{Only used internally}
}
\value{
A list with two objects: \code{clusterfile} and \code{stats}. \code{Clusterfile} is a matrix with all unique clusters as columns and loci as rows, where \code{TRUE} indicates the presense of a locus in a specific cluster (else \code{FALSE} is given). \code{Stats} is a data frame that gives all edges for the \code{single linkage clustering tree} along with the following information for each edge: cluster (focal cluster), parent cluster (cluster efter merger), and the corresponding \code{nV}, \code{nE}, and \eqn{\lambda} for each cluster (cluster). Each cluster is given a unique name which indicates the highest LD threshold at which it is present.

\description{
Takes a lower diagonal matrix of pairwise LD values and produces data files for subsequent LD network analyses.

\details{
In LDna clusters represent loci (vertices) connected by LD values (edges) above given thresholds. From a lower diagonal matrix of LD values a \code{a clustering algorithim} (see \code{\link{hclust}}) is used to produce a tree that describes cluster merging with decreasing LD threshold. In these trees nodes represent clusters/loci and node distance indicates LD threshold values at which these events occur. To identify mergers of distinct clusters, the change in median LD before and after merger, \eqn{\lambda}, is calculated for all clusters in the tree. \eqn{\lambda} is defined as \eqn{(x_1-x_2)*n} where \eqn{x_1} is the median of all pairwise LD values within the focal cluster, \eqn{x_2} is the median of all pairwise values between loci within the focal cluster and between the loci in the focal cluster and any other loci it merges with, and \eqn{n} is the number of loci in the focal cluster. High values of \eqn{\lambda}, relative to the median of all values across the tree, indicate the merging of clusters with highly distinct LD signals. For each cluster the number of vertices, \code{nV}, the number of edges, \code{nE} are recorded. \code{LDnaRaw} includes  \code{\link{mclapply}} to enable the use of multiple cores. 
The clustering method \code{method} can now be specfied. For 'strict' clusters use 'single' (e.g. for outlier or inversion detection), for chromosome binning, use 'average', 'complete' or 'median'.
R2 values can be rounded to limit (\code{digits}) number of clustering events in large data sets, but too much leads to problems when recursively collapsing (too large) polytomies.
