Description: R package for linkage disequilibrium (LD) network analysis (LDna).
    In LD networks nodes represent loci and connections between nodes represent
    LD values a given thresholds. Distinct clusters visible across a wide range
    of LD thresholds are expected to be associated with distinct evolutionary
    events or forces. By monitoring change in LD as clusters successively merge
    with decreasing LD threshold, such distinct clusters can be identified and
    extracted at appropriate LD thresholds. Cluster merging is visualized using
    trees, where nodes represent clusters and node distance distance indicates
    lowest LD threshold at which the cluster is present. Functions are provided
    to: produce necessary data files for LDna from a matrix of pairwise LD
    values; calculate lambda, which measured the change in LD before and after
    cluster merging and is used to identify distinct clusters; extract clusters
    based on user defined parameters; summerize data and visualise results,
    both when extracting clusers and when exploring the extracted clusters.
